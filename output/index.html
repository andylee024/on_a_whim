<p><img src="/assets/andy1.png" title="Andy&#39;s profile" height="600" /></p>
<p>Hello. My name is Andy. I wear a few hats. I am currently a motion planning engineer at <a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/">Uber ATG</a> (Advanced Technologies Group), Uber’s R&amp;D division for self-driving cars. I am a former startup founder of Ikigai, a computational drug-discovery startup focused on Alzheimer’s (accepted to YCombinator Summer 2018). I also formerly collaborated with the <a href="http://www.pfenninglab.org/">Neurogenomics Laboratory</a>, a computational biology lab using machine learning to identify epigenetic drug targets for Alzheimer’s.</p>
<h1 id="on-a-whim">On a Whim</h1>
<p>I care about technology that impacts the world in a profoundly positive way and the process by which the world adopts that technology. This blog is named “On a Whim” because I believe transformative technology is started by scientists, entrepreneurs, dreamers who pursue an idea on a whim. To that end, “On a Whim” is my vehicle for communicating thoughts on two of my passions: math and entrepreneurship.</p>
